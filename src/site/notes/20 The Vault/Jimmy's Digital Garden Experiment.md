It's gonna be messy for a while. There will be [[ghost notes\|ghost notes]]. There will be broken links. That's the whole point. I'm also going to see what posting what would otherwise be a blog post here can do.

A sample blog post: [[The Blog/Apple's Trojan Horse, Services Edition\|Apple's Trojan Horse, Services Edition]]

Some Readwise book highlights: [[20 The Vault/Slipbox/Atomic Habits\|Atomic Habits]], [[20 The Vault/Slipbox/Digital Minimalism\|Digital Minimalism]], [[90 Media/Books/Four Thousand Weeks\|Four Thousand Weeks]]
