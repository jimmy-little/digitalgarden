## Highlights
that they start with a blank screen or sheet of paper.[1] But by doing this, they ignore the main part, namely note-taking, failing to understand that improving the organisation of all writing makes a difference. ([Location 126](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=126))_

----
Writing is not what follows research, learning or studying, it is the medium of all this work. ([Location 134](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=134))_

----
What can we do differently in the weeks, months or even years before we face the blank page that will get us into the best possible position to write a great paper easily? ([Location 149](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=149))_

----
Willpower is, as far as we know today,[2] a limited resource that depletes quickly and is also not that much up for improvement over the long term ([Location 172](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=172))_

----
If you can trust the system, you can let go of the attempt to hold everything together in your head and you can start focusing on what is important: The content, the argument and the ideas. ([Location 192](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=192))_

----
it is not just about collecting thoughts, but about making connections and sparking new ideas. ([Location 246](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=246))_

----
The first idea lies at the heart of this book and is the technique of the simple slip-box. ([Location 260](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=260))_

----
Only if they are embedded in a well-conceived working process can the tools play out their strengths. There is no point in having great tools if they don’t fit together. ([Location 297](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=297))_

----
Niklas Luhmann. ([Location 308](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=308))_

----
He soon developed new categories of these notes. He realised that one idea, one note was only as valuable as its context, which was not necessarily the context it was taken from. ([Location 318](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=318))_

----
He turned to his slip-box and with its help he put together a doctoral thesis and the habilitation thesis in less than a year – while taking classes in sociology. ([Location 331](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=331))_

----
“The Society of Society” ([Location 338](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=338))_

----
The best way to maintain the feeling of being in control is to stay in control. ([Location 374](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=374))_

----
If we work in an environment that is flexible enough to accommodate our work rhythm, we don’t need to struggle with resistance. ([Location 380](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=380))_

----
Studies on highly successful people have proven again and again that success is not the result of strong willpower and the ability to overcome resistance, but rather the result of smart working environments that avoid resistance in the first place ([Location 381](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=381))_

----
Whenever he read something, he would write the bibliographic information on one side of a card and make brief notes about the content on the other side (Schmidt 2013, 170). These notes would end up in the bibliographic slip-box. ([Location 419](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=419))_

----
He did not just copy ideas or quotes from the texts he read, but made a transition from one context to another. ([Location 431](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=431))_

----
The trick is that he did not organise his notes by topic, but in the rather abstract way of giving them fixed numbers. ([Location 435](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=435))_

----
Writing is, without dispute, the best facilitator for thinking, reading, learning, understanding and generating ideas we have. ([Location 494](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=494))_

----
You have to externalise your ideas, you have to write. ([Location 502](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=502))_

----
Develop your topics, questions and research projects bottom up from within the system. ([Location 539](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=539))_

----
Your topic is now based on what you have, not based on an unfounded idea about what the literature you are about to read might provide. ([Location 549](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=549))_

----
the only way to find out if something is worth reading is by reading it (even just bits of it), ([Location 568](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=568))_

----
Every idea adds to what can become a critical mass that turns a mere collection of ideas into an idea-generator. ([Location 571](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=571))_

----
accidental encounters make up the majority of what we learn. ([Location 579](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=579))_

----
Soon, you will be able to access the whole digitalised slip-box online. ([Location 676](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=676))_

----
The moment the author can be removed from the scene, the written piece is a public claim on truth. ([Location 716](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=716))_

----
Malcom McLean, ([Location 746](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=746))_

----
They tried to benefit from the obvious simplicity of loading containers onto ships without letting go of what they were used to. ([Location 767](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=767))_

----
In the old system, the question is: Under which topic do I store this note? In the new system, the question is: In which context will I want to stumble upon it again? ([Location 787](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=787))_

----
The slip-box is designed to present you with ideas you have already forgotten, allowing your brain to focus on thinking instead of remembering. ([Location 797](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=797))_

----
Fleeting notes are only useful if you review them within a day or so and turn them into proper notes you can use later. ([Location 844](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=844))_

----
Permanent notes, on the other hand, are written in a way that can still be understood even when you have forgotten the context they are taken from. ([Location 848](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=848))_

----
By focusing on what is interesting and keeping written track of your own intellectual development, topics, questions and arguments will emerge from the material without force. ([Location 933](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=933))_

----
it is no wonder that almost every guide on writing recommends to start with brainstorming. If you haven’t written along the way, the brain is indeed the only place to turn to. ([Location 944](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=944))***
_Note: Taking good notes means your brain is already stormed._

----
the problem of finding a topic is replaced by the problem of having too many topics to write about. ([Location 955](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=955))_

----
How can you not have trouble finding a topic if you believe you have to decide on one before you have done your research, ([Location 960](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=960))_

----
You may remember from school the difference between an exergonic and an endergonic reaction. In the first case, you constantly need to add energy to keep the process going. In the second case, the reaction, once triggered, continues by itself and even releases energy. ([Location 986](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=986))***
_Note: Need to continually add energy to keep it going_

----
Any attempts to trick ourselves into work with external rewards (like doing something nice after finishing a chapter) are only short-term solutions with no prospect of establishing a positive feedback loop. ([Location 995](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=995))_

----
nothing is a bigger hindrance to personal growth than having a “fixed mindset.” ([Location 1012](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=1012))_

----
the fact that the fear of failure has the ugliest name of all phobias: Kakorrhaphiophobia. ([Location 1020](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=1020))_

----
We tend to think we understand what we read – until we try to rewrite it in our own words. ([Location 1032](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=1032))_

----
Expressing our own thoughts in writing makes us realise if we really thought them through. The moment we try to combine them with previously written notes, the system will unambiguously show us contradictions, inconsistencies and repetitions. ([Location 1042](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=1042))_

----
Give Each Task Your Undivided Attention ([Location 1072](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=1072))_

----
Multitasking is not a good idea ([Location 1086](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=1086))_

----
While those who multitasked felt more productive, their productivity actually decreased ([Location 1095](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=1095))_

----
When we think we multitask, what we really do is shift our attention quickly between two (or more) things. And every shift is a drain on our ability to shift and delays the moment we manage to get focused again. Trying to multitask fatigues us and decreases our ability to deal with more than one task. ([Location 1102](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=1102))_

----
doing something many times makes us believe we have become good at it – completely independent of our actual performance (Bornstein 1989). ([Location 1107](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=1107))_

----
We unfortunately tend to confuse familiarity with skill. ([Location 1108](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=1108))_

----
It is not only impossible to focus on more than one thing at a time, but also to have a different kind of attention on more than one thing at a time. ([Location 1115](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=1115))
***Tags: [[20 The Vault/Fleeting/favorite\|favorite]] _

----
When it comes to focused attention, we focus on one thing only, something we can sustain for only a few seconds. ([Location 1123](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=1123))_

----
Focused attention is different from “sustained attention,” which we need to stay focused on one task for a longer period and is necessary to learn, understand or get something done. This is the kind of attention that is most certainly under threat from an increase in distractions. ([Location 1124](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=1124))
***Tags: [[20 The Vault/Fleeting/favorite\|favorite]] _

----
The average duration seems to have shrunken quite considerably over time – we practice much less focused attention than we used to (ibid). ([Location 1126](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=1126))_

----
Give Each Task the Right Kind of Attention ([Location 1135](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=1135))_

----
Letting the inner critic interfere with the author isn’t helpful, either. ([Location 1150](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=1150))_

----
We need to get our thoughts on paper first and improve them there, ([Location 1152](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=1152))_

----
Outlining or changing the outline is also a very different task that requires a very different focus on something else: not on one thought, but on the whole argument. ([Location 1161](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=1161))_

----
To master the art of writing, we need to be able to apply whatever kind of attention and focus is needed. ([Location 1175](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=1175))_

----
The moment we stop making plans is the moment we start to learn. ([Location 1202](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=1202))_

----
In an experiment, beginner and expert paramedics and their teachers were shown scenes of CPR performed by either experienced paramedics or those who had just finished their training (Flyvbjerg 2001).[19] As you might expect, the experienced paramedics were able to spot their kind correctly in almost all cases (~90%), while the beginners were more or less just guessing (~50%). So far, so good. But when the teachers watched the videos, they systematically mistook the beginners for experts and the experts for beginners. They were wrong in most of the cases (and only right in about a third of all the cases). ([Location 1224](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=1224))_

----
Teachers tend to mistake the ability to follow (their) rules with the ability to make the right choices in real situations. ([Location 1231](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=1231))_

----
gut feeling is not a mysterious force, but an incorporated history of experience. ([Location 1243](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=1243))_

----
Information cannot be saved in short-term memory like on a memory stick. Rather, it kind of floats around in our heads, seeks our attention and occupies valuable mental resources until it is either forgotten, replaced by something more important (according to our brains) or moved into long-term memory. ([Location 1265](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=1265))_

----
Zeigarnik effect: Open tasks tend to occupy our short-term memory – until they are done. ([Location 1297](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=1297))_

----
we also know that we don’t actually have to finish tasks to convince our brains to stop thinking about them. All we have to do is to write them down in a way that convinces us that it will be taken care of. ([Location 1299](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=1299))_

----
willpower is compared to muscles: a limited resource that depletes quickly and needs time to recover. ([Location 1333](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=1333))_

----
By always using the same notebook for making quick notes, always extracting the main ideas from a text in the same way and always turning them into the same kind of permanent notes, which are always dealt with in the same manner, the number of decisions during a work session can be greatly reduced. ([Location 1358](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=1358))_

----
“I would advise you to read with a pen in your hand and enter in a little book short hints of what you feel that is common or that may be useful; for this will be the best method of imprinting such portcullis in your memory.” – Benjamin Franklin[26] ([Location 1373](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=1373))_

----
When we extract ideas from the specific context of a text, we deal with ideas that serve a specific purpose in a particular context, support a specific argument, are part of a theory ([Location 1395](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=1395))_

----
that isn’t ours or written in a language we wouldn’t use. This is why we have to translate them into our own language ([Location 1397](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=1397))_

----
even if you use ten different colours for underlining and a SQ8R reading technique. But all of this would be just an extra step before you do the only step that really counts, which is to take the permanent note that will add value to the actual slip-box. ([Location 1429](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=1429))_

----
Confirmation bias is a subtle but major force. ([Location 1468](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=1468))_

----
The linear process promoted by most study guides, which insanely starts with the decision on the hypothesis or the topic to write about, is a sure-fire way to let confirmation bias run rampant. ([Location 1484](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=1484))_

----
Extracting the gist of a text or an idea and giving an account in writing is for academics what daily practice on the piano is for pianists: The more often we do it and the more focused we are, the more virtuous we become. ([Location 1526](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=1526))_

----
the best-researched and most successful learning method is elaboration. ([Location 1648](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=1648))_

----
The brain, as Kahneman writes, is “a machine for jumping to conclusions” (Kahneman, 2013, 79). ([Location 1748](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=1748))_

----
Transferring ideas into the external memory also allows us to forget them. And even though it sounds paradoxical, forgetting actually facilitates long-term learning. ([Location 1820](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=1820))_
