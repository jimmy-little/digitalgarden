## Highlights
The core of strategy work is always the same: discovering the critical factors in a situation and designing a way of coordinating and focusing actions to deal with those factors. ([Location 160](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004J4WKEC&location=160))_

----
Strategy cannot be a useful concept if it is a synonym for success. ([Location 216](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004J4WKEC&location=216))_

----
A good strategy has an essential logical structure that I call the kernel. The kernel of a strategy contains three elements: a diagnosis, a guiding policy, and coherent action. ([Location 241](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004J4WKEC&location=241))_

----
Bad strategy is more than just the absence of good strategy. ([Location 250](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004J4WKEC&location=250))_

----
The most basic idea of strategy is the application of strength against weakness. ([Location 260](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004J4WKEC&location=260))_

----
He just smiled and said, “I am going to wait for the next big thing.” ([Location 336](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004J4WKEC&location=336))_

----
identify your strengths and weaknesses, assess the opportunities and risks (your opponent’s strengths and weaknesses), and build on your strengths. ([Location 587](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004J4WKEC&location=587))_

----
At the center of these documents lay President George W. Bush’s dramatic new doctrine of responding to the threat of weapons of mass destruction with preventive war, if necessary. Yet there were no indications that this doctrine had been turned into a coherent strategy. ([Location 633](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004J4WKEC&location=633))_

----
Bad strategy is long on goals and short on policy or action. It assumes that goals are all you need. It puts forward strategic objectives that are incoherent and, sometimes, totally impracticable. It uses high-sounding words and phrases to hide these failings. ([Location 677](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004J4WKEC&location=677))_

----
Fluff masquerades as expertise, thought, and analysis. ([Location 683](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004J4WKEC&location=683))_

----
strategy is a way through a difficulty, an approach to overcoming an obstacle, a response to a challenge. If the challenge is not defined, it is difficult or impossible to assess the quality of the strategy. ([Location 739](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004J4WKEC&location=739))_

----
If you fail to identify and analyze the obstacles, you don’t have a strategy. Instead, you have either a stretch goal, a budget, or a list of things you wish would happen. ([Location 763](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004J4WKEC&location=763))_

----
Motivation is an essential part of life and success, and a leader may justly ask for “one last push,” but the leader’s job is more than that. The job of the leader is also to create the conditions that will make that push effective, to have a strategy worthy of the effort called upon. ([Location 863](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004J4WKEC&location=863))_

----
Logan’s “key strategies” had little to do with strategy. They were simply performance goals. ([Location 889](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004J4WKEC&location=889))_

----
most corporate strategic plans are simply three-year or five-year rolling budgets combined with market share projections. ([Location 892](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004J4WKEC&location=892))_

----
To obtain higher performance, leaders must identify the critical obstacles to forward progress and then develop a coherent approach to overcoming them. ([Location 899](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004J4WKEC&location=899))_

----
The need for true strategy work is episodic, not necessarily annual. ([Location 904](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004J4WKEC&location=904))_

----
To help clarify this distinction it is helpful to use the word “goal” to express overall values and desires and to use the word “objective” to denote specific operational targets. ([Location 912](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004J4WKEC&location=912))_

----
It is strategy which transforms these vague overall goals into a coherent set of actionable objectives—defeat ([Location 914](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004J4WKEC&location=914))_

----
Good strategy works by focusing energy and resources on one, or a very few, pivotal objectives whose accomplishment will lead to a cascade of favorable outcomes. ([Location 933](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004J4WKEC&location=933))_

----
The purpose of good strategy is to offer a potentially achievable way of surmounting a key challenge. ([Location 950](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004J4WKEC&location=950))_

----
When a leader characterizes the challenge as underperformance, it sets the stage for bad strategy. Underperformance is a result. The true challenges are the reasons for the underperformance ([Location 968](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004J4WKEC&location=968))_

----
bad strategy is not miscalculation. ([Location 1004](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004J4WKEC&location=1004))_

----
Bad strategy flourishes because it floats above analysis, logic, and choice, held aloft by the hot hope that one can avoid dealing with these tricky fundamentals and the difficulties of mastering them. ([Location 1008](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004J4WKEC&location=1008))_

----
One common reason for choosing avoidance is the pain or difficulty of choice. ([Location 1010](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004J4WKEC&location=1010))_

----
second pathway to bad strategy is the siren song of template-style strategy—filling in the blanks with vision, mission, ([Location 1011](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004J4WKEC&location=1011))_

----
A third pathway to bad strategy is New Thought—the belief that all you need to succeed is a positive mental attitude. ([Location 1013](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004J4WKEC&location=1013))_

----
universal buy-in usually signals the absence of choice. ([Location 1099](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004J4WKEC&location=1099))_

----
Traditionally, charisma was associated with religious and political leaders, not CEOs or school principals. ([Location 1114](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004J4WKEC&location=1114))_

----
This conceptual scheme has been hugely popular with college-educated people who have to manage other college-educated people. It satisfies their sense that organizations should somehow be forced to change and improve ([Location 1128](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004J4WKEC&location=1128))_

----
Whatever you think about this definition of leadership, a problem arises when it is confused with strategy. ([Location 1131](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004J4WKEC&location=1131))_

----
If you form and hold your intent long enough, it becomes true.… You become extremely clear about what it is you want to do.… ([Location 1290](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004J4WKEC&location=1290))_

----
The kernel of a strategy contains three elements: A diagnosis that defines or explains the nature of the challenge. A good diagnosis simplifies the often overwhelming complexity of reality by identifying certain aspects of the situation as critical. A guiding policy for dealing with the challenge. This is an overall approach chosen to cope with or overcome the obstacles identified in the diagnosis. A set of coherent actions that are designed to carry out the guiding policy. These are steps that are coordinated with one another to work together in accomplishing the guiding policy. ([Location 1309](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004J4WKEC&location=1309))_

----
The first step toward effective strategy is diagnosing the specific structure of the challenge rather than simply naming performance goals. ([Location 1322](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004J4WKEC&location=1322))_

----
this combination of three elements the kernel to emphasize that it is the bare-bones center of a strategy—the ([Location 1330](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004J4WKEC&location=1330))_

----
A great deal of strategy work is trying to figure out what is going on. Not just deciding what to do, but the more fundamental problem of comprehending the situation. ([Location 1342](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004J4WKEC&location=1342))_

----
diagnosis is a judgment about the meanings of facts. ([Location 1364](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004J4WKEC&location=1364))_

----
Good strategy is not just “what” you are trying to do. It is also “why” and “how” you are doing it. ([Location 1435](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004J4WKEC&location=1435))_

----
strategy is primarily about deciding what is truly important and focusing resources and action on that objective. ([Location 1530](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004J4WKEC&location=1530))_

----
Strategy is visible as coordinated action imposed on a system. ([Location 1561](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004J4WKEC&location=1561))_

----
From a psychological perspective, there can be returns to focus or concentration when people ignore signals below a certain threshold (called a “salience effect” in psychology) or when they believe in momentum—that success leads to success. ([Location 1708](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004J4WKEC&location=1708))_

----
Many writers on strategy seem to suggest that the more dynamic the situation, the farther ahead a leader must look. This is illogical. The more dynamic the situation, the poorer your foresight will be. ([Location 1817](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004J4WKEC&location=1817))_

----
There are portions of organizations, and even of economies, that are chain-linked. When each link is managed somewhat separately, the system can get stuck in a low-effectiveness state. ([Location 1911](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004J4WKEC&location=1911))_

----
if you are in charge of one link of the chain, there is no point in investing resources in making your link better if other link managers are not. ([Location 1914](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004J4WKEC&location=1914))_

----
By definition, winging it is not a strategy. ([Location 2075](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004J4WKEC&location=2075))_

----
It is also human nature to associate current profit with recent actions, even though it should be evident that current plenty is the harvest of planting seasons long past. ([Location 2218](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004J4WKEC&location=2218))_

----
My objectives are not to show my class how to manage a can company, or even how to create a good strategy. Instead, they are (1) to teach them how to identify a company’s strategy, (2) to deepen their skills at analyzing qualitative information, and (3) to explore a particular mixture of policy and positioning called focus. ([Location 2304](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004J4WKEC&location=2304))_

----
“If we are not going to automatically accept the opinions of others, how can we independently identify a company’s strategy? We do this by looking at each policy of the company and noticing those that are different from the norm in the industry. ([Location 2352](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004J4WKEC&location=2352))_

----
Here, the word “focus” has two meanings. First, it denotes the coordination of policies that produces extra power through their interacting and overlapping effects. Second, it denotes the application of that power to the right target. ([Location 2416](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004J4WKEC&location=2416))_

----
basic industry analysis and could have been easily predicted by the use of the popular Five Forces framework developed by Michael Porter. ([Location 2463](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004J4WKEC&location=2463))_
