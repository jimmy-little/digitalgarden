## Highlights
Mindfulness simply means to pay attention, to be present, to be engaged, to be aware, to be conscious. When you apply these behaviors to your relationship, it can only grow stronger and more joyful. ([Location 106](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078HYGSRJ&location=106))_

Criticism is different from making a complaint about your partner’s behavior. A complaint is an issue with the behavior, not the person. ([Location 232](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078HYGSRJ&location=232))_

----
Stonewalling allows you to shut down and avoid responding altogether, or you respond in monosyllables or curt replies. ([Location 238](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078HYGSRJ&location=238))***
