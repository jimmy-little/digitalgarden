## Highlights
machine learning is all around you. ([Location 67](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B012271YB2&location=67))_

Machine learning is something new under the sun: a technology that builds itself. ([Location 125](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B012271YB2&location=125))_

“Computers are useless,” said Picasso. “They can only give you answers.” ([Location 127](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B012271YB2&location=127))_

The psychologist Don Norman coined the term conceptual model to refer to the rough knowledge of a technology we need to have in order to use it effectively. ([Location 156](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B012271YB2&location=156))_

Symbolists view learning as the inverse of deduction and take ideas from philosophy, psychology, and logic. Connectionists reverse engineer the brain and are inspired by neuroscience and physics. Evolutionaries simulate evolution on the computer and draw on genetics and evolutionary biology. Bayesians believe learning is a form of probabilistic inference and have their roots in statistics. Analogizers learn by extrapolating from similarity judgments and are influenced by psychology and mathematical optimization. Driven by the goal of building learning machines, we’ll tour a good chunk of the intellectual history of the last hundred years and see it in a new light.
