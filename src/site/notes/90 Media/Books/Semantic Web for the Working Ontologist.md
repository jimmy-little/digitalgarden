## Highlights
But after the ratification of the Shapes Constraint Language (SHACL) for RDF, the release of Schema.org, and the settling down of a protocol for sharing data on the web (the Linked Data Protocol), this answer became disingenuous at best.

----
An ontologist might do their work as part of an Enterprise Knowledge Graph, a data lake, global linked data, graph data, or any of a number of other technological approaches that share the idea that data is more powerful when it comes together in a meaningful way. ([Location 358](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09CLX2Z45&location=358))_

----
Web architecture was built by standing on the shoulders of giants. Writing in The Atlantic magazine in 1945 [Bush and Wang 1945], Vannevar Bush identified the problems in managing large collections of documents and the links we make between them. ([Location 369](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09CLX2Z45&location=369))_

----
he called the Memex (“memory extension”) that would assist us in studying, linking, and remembering the documents we work with and the association links we weave between them. ([Location 373](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09CLX2Z45&location=373))***
_Note: Vennevar Bush coined Memex_

----
Ted Nelson quoted As We May Think and proposed using a computer to implement the idea, using hypertext and hypermedia structures to link parts of documents together. ([Location 374](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09CLX2Z45&location=374))***
_Note: Eason proposed automating Memex with computers in the 60s_

----
The beginning of the seventies brought the work of Vinton Cerf and the emergence of the Internet, which connected computers all around the world. ([Location 377](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09CLX2Z45&location=377))_

----
By the end of the eighties, Tim Berners-Lee was able to stand on the shoulders of these giants when he proposed a new breakthrough: an architecture for distributing hypermedia on the Internet, which we now know as the WWW. ([Location 378](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09CLX2Z45&location=378))***
_Note: Bush Nelson Englebart Cerf Berners-Lee Internet_

----
We need a way to link together data that is distributed throughout an industry. ([Location 476](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09CLX2Z45&location=476))_

----
In the restaurant example, we had data (opening hours, daily special, holiday closings) published so that they can be read by the human eye, but our automated assistant couldn’t read them. ([Location 477](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09CLX2Z45&location=477))_

----
The unifying theme in all of these examples is a move from a presentation of information for a specific audience, requiring interpretation from a human being, to an exchange of data between machines. ([Location 487](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09CLX2Z45&location=487))***
_Note: Need to provide both human-readable and machine efficient data_

----
The main idea of the Semantic Web is to support a distributed Web at the level of the data rather than at the level of the presentation. ([Location 497](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09CLX2Z45&location=497))_

----
Distributed data means that the data comes from multiple stakeholders, and we need to understand how to bring the data together in a meaningful way. ([Location 507](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09CLX2Z45&location=507))_

----
The data model that the Semantic Web uses to represent this distributed web of data is called the Resource Description Framework (RDF) ([Location 512](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09CLX2Z45&location=512))_

----
The Linked Open Data Cloud includes datasets that share some common reference; the web of data itself is of course much larger. ([Location 564](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09CLX2Z45&location=564))_

----
The Semantic Web is often mistaken for an effort to make everyone agree on a single ontology, that is, to make everyone agree on a single set of terms—but that just isn’t the way the Web works. ([Location 605](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09CLX2Z45&location=605))_

----
Coming up with good, agreed-on global names is not always easy business. ([Location 626](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09CLX2Z45&location=626))_

----
we cannot assume that just because two URIs are distinct, they refer to distinct resources. This feature of the Semantic Web is called the Nonunique Naming Assumption; ([Location 631](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09CLX2Z45&location=631))_

----
An Open World in this sense is one in which we must assume at any time that new information could come to light, and we may draw no conclusions that rely on assuming that the information available at any one point is all the information available. ([Location 648](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09CLX2Z45&location=648))_

----
contrast to the Open World Assumption, most data systems operate under the Closed World Assumption, that is, if we are missing some data in a document or a record, then that data is simply not available. ([Location 661](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09CLX2Z45&location=661))_

----
With a machine combining information, how do we bring any order to the chaos? How can one have any confidence in the information we merge from multiple sources? ([Location 687](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09CLX2Z45&location=687))_

----
How can such a mess become something useful? That is the challenge that faces the working ontologist. Their medium is the distributed web of data; their tools are the Semantic Web languages RDF, RDF Schema (RDFS), SPARQL, Simple Knowledge Organization System (SKOS), Shapes Constraint Language (SHACL), and Web Ontology ([Location 689](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09CLX2Z45&location=689))_

----
Language (OWL). Their craft is to make sensible, usable, and durable information resources from this medium. We call that craft modeling, and it is the centerpiece of this book. ([Location 691](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09CLX2Z45&location=691))_

----
The AAA slogan—Anyone can say Anything about Any topic. One of the basic tenets of the Web in general and the Semantic Web in particular. ([Location 703](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09CLX2Z45&location=703))_

----
Open World/Closed World—A consequence of the AAA slogan is that there could always be something new that someone will say; this means that we must assume that there is always more information that could be known. ([Location 705](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09CLX2Z45&location=705))_

----
Nonunique naming—Since the speakers on the Web won’t necessarily coordinate their naming efforts, the same entity could be known by more than one name. ([Location 707](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09CLX2Z45&location=707))_

----
The network effect—The property of a web that makes it grow organically. The value of joining in increases with the number of people who have joined, resulting in a virtuous cycle of participation. ([Location 709](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09CLX2Z45&location=709))_

----
The data wilderness—The condition of most data on the Web. It contains valuable information, but there is no guarantee that it will be orderly or readily understandable. ([Location 711](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09CLX2Z45&location=711))_

----
Models help people communicate. A model describes the situation in a particular way that other people can understand. ([Location 725](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09CLX2Z45&location=725))_

----
Models explain and make predictions. A model relates primitive phenomena to one another and to more complex phenomena, providing explanations and predictions about the world. ([Location 727](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09CLX2Z45&location=727))_

----
Models mediate among multiple viewpoints. No two people agree completely on what they want to know about a phenomenon; models represent their commonalities while allowing them to explore their differences. ([Location 729](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09CLX2Z45&location=729))_

----
When a model relies on particulars of the context of its reader for interpretation of its meaning, as is the case in legislation, we say that a model is informal. That is, the model lacks a formalism whereby the meaning of terms in the model can be uniquely defined. ([Location 777](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09CLX2Z45&location=777))_

----
The resulting collection of tags and their relations is called a Folksonomy to reflect the fact this is a categorization from and by the crowd. ([Location 797](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09CLX2Z45&location=797))***
_Note: A system can benefit from a Folksonomy tag array. Less strict, but also lower priority in the graph._

----
Models are used to organize human thought in the form of explanations. ([Location 834](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09CLX2Z45&location=834))_

----
An explanation relates a phenomenon to “first principles”; these principles, and the rules by which they are related, do not depend on interpretation by the consumer but instead are in some objective form that stands outside the communication. ([Location 846](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09CLX2Z45&location=846))_

----
The Semantic Web standards also use this idea of class hierarchy for representing commonality and variability. ([Location 898](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09CLX2Z45&location=898))_

----
High-level classes represent commonality among a large variety of entities, whereas lower-level classes represent commonality among a small, specific set of things. ([Location 900](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09CLX2Z45&location=900))_

----
All of these people have contributions to make to the web of knowledge, but the kinds of contributions they make are very different, and they need different tools. This difference is one of level of expressivity. ([Location 969](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09CLX2Z45&location=969))_

----
RDF—The Resource Description Framework. ([Location 996](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09CLX2Z45&location=996))_

----
RDF provides a mechanism for allowing anyone to make a basic statement about anything and layering these statements into a single model. ([Location 997](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09CLX2Z45&location=997))_

----
SHACL—The Shapes Constraint Language. SHACL is a language based on the intuition that we expect data to be in a certain form, or shape. ([Location 1000](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09CLX2Z45&location=1000))_

----
RDFS—The RDF Schema Language. RDFS is a language with the expressivity to describe the basic notions of commonality and variability familiar from object languages and other class systems—namely classes, subclasses, and properties. ([Location 1005](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09CLX2Z45&location=1005))_

----
RDFS-Plus. RDFS-Plus is a subset of Web Ontology Language (OWL) that is more expressive than RDFS but without the complexity of OWL. ([Location 1007](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09CLX2Z45&location=1007))_

----
OWL—the Web Ontology Language. OWL brings the expressivity of logic to the Semantic Web. It allows modelers to express detailed constraints between classes, entities, and properties. ([Location 1013](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09CLX2Z45&location=1013))_

----
Modeling—Making sense of unorganized information. ([Location 1035](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09CLX2Z45&location=1035))_

----
Formality/informality—The degree to which the meaning of a modeling language is given independent of the particular speaker or audience. ([Location 1037](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09CLX2Z45&location=1037))_

----
Commonality and variability—When describing a set of things, some of them will have some things in common (commonality), and some will have important differences (variability). Managing commonality and variability is a fundamental aspect of modeling in general, and of Semantic Web models in particular. ([Location 1038](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09CLX2Z45&location=1038))_

----
Expressivity—The ability of a modeling language to describe certain aspects of the world. More expressive modeling language can express a wider variety of statements ([Location 1041](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09CLX2Z45&location=1041))_

----
about the model. ([Location 1043](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09CLX2Z45&location=1043))_

----
Resource Description Framework (RDF), Resource Description Framework Schema (RDFS), and Web Ontology Language (OWL) are the basic representation languages of the Semantic Web, with RDF serving as the foundation. ([Location 1046](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09CLX2Z45&location=1046))_

----
The essence of the merge process comes down to answering the question “When is a node in one graph the same node as a node in another graph?” In RDF, this issue is resolved through the use of Uniform Resource Identifiers (URIs). ([Location 1155](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09CLX2Z45&location=1155))_

----
a simplified version of a URI abbreviation scheme called CURIEs (standing for Compact URI). In its simplest form, a URI expressed as a CURIE has two parts: a namespace and an identifier, written with a colon between. So the CURIE representation for the identifier England in the namespace geo is simply geo:England. The RDF standard syntaxes include elaborate rules that allow programmers to map namespaces to other URI representations (such as the familiar http:// notation). ([Location 1221](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09CLX2Z45&location=1221))_

----
In general, these are cases in which it is, or at least seems, desirable to make a statement about another statement. This process is called reification. ([Location 1464](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09CLX2Z45&location=1464))_

----
Since this is the Web, that name will be in the form of a URI. The RDF standard provides a means for doing this—it is called the named graph. The idea of a named graph is quite simple; we refer to a set of triples with a name, which itself is a URI. ([Location 1522](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09CLX2Z45&location=1522))_

----
RDF is a simple standard; its job is to model distributed data on the Web. It accomplishes this job, and nothing more. If you want to model data in a distributed way, you can either use RDF or you will re-invent it; there isn’t very much to it. The basic idea of RDF is that, in a distributed setting, you need a global identifier for anything you refer to. If you want to connect that to some other thing, you will need a name for that. And if you want to connect them, you’ll need a name for the connection. All of these names have to be global. ([Location 1684](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09CLX2Z45&location=1684))_

----
Fundamental concepts The following fundamental concepts were introduced in this chapter. •  RDF (Resource Description Framework)—This distributes data on the Web. •  Triple—The fundamental data structure of RDF. A triple is made up of a subject, predicate, and object. •  Graph—A nodes-and-links structural view of RDF data. •  Merging—The process of treating two graphs as if they were one. •  URI (Uniform Resource Indicator)—A generalization of the URL (Uniform Resource Locator), which is the global name on the Web. ([Location 1697](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09CLX2Z45&location=1697))_

----
namespace—A set of names that belongs to a single authority. Namespaces allow different agents to use the same word in different ways. •  CURIE—An abbreviated version of a URI, it is made up of a namespace identifier and a name, separated by a colon. •  rdf:type—The relationship between an instance and its type. •  rdf:Property—The type of any property in RDF. •  Reification—The practice of making a statement about another statement. It is done in RDF using •  rdf:subject, rdf:predicate, and Nonerdf:object. •  N-Triples, Turtle, RDF/XML—The serialization syntaxes for RDF. •  Blank nodes—RDF nodes that have no URI and thus cannot be referenced globally. They are used to stand in for anonymous entities. ([Location 1706](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09CLX2Z45&location=1706))_

----
Resource Description Framework (RDF) can represent data in a distributed way across the Web. As such, it forms the basis for the Semantic Web, a web of data in which Anyone can say Anything about Any topic (AAA). ([Location 1723](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09CLX2Z45&location=1723))_

----
RDF Parser/serializer: We have already seen a number of serializations of RDF. An RDF parser reads text in one (or more) of these formats and interprets it as triples in the RDF data model. An RDF serializer does the reverse; it takes a set of triples and creates a file that expresses that content in one of the serialization forms. ([Location 1735](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09CLX2Z45&location=1735))_

----
RDF store: We have seen how RDF distributes data in the form of triples. An RDF store (sometimes called a triple store) is a database that is tuned for storing and retrieving data in the form of triples. In addition to the familiar functions of any database, an RDF store has the additional ability to merge information from multiple data sources, as defined by the RDF standard. ([Location 1739](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09CLX2Z45&location=1739))_

----
RDF query engine: Closely related to the RDF store is the RDF query engine. The query engine provides the capability to retrieve information from an RDF store according to structured queries. ([Location 1742](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09CLX2Z45&location=1742))_

----
Application: An application has some work that it performs with the data it processes: analysis, user interaction, archiving, and so forth. These capabilities are accomplished using some programming language that accesses the RDF store via queries (processed with the RDF query engine). ([Location 1744](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09CLX2Z45&location=1744))_

----
Reasoning engine: A reasoner or reasoning engine is closely related to the RDF store or query engine and provides the capability to infer logical consequences from RDF data and schemata. ([Location 1747](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09CLX2Z45&location=1747))_

----
There is no standard serialization of a relational database that will allow it to be imported into a competing relational database system without a change of semantics. (This is a key advantage of RDF stores over traditional data stores.) ([Location 1753](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09CLX2Z45&location=1753))_

----
The triples at this point could also be serialized back out, either in the same text form or in another text form. This is done using the reverse operation of the parser: the serializer. ([Location 1764](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09CLX2Z45&location=1764))_

----
W3C provides Recommendations called R2RML (Relational To RDF Markup Language) [Sundara et al. 2012] and the Direct Mapping [Bertails et al. 2012] ([Location 1794](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09CLX2Z45&location=1794))_

----
There are several ways to embed RDF data into an HTML web page. The most commonly used ones today are Microdata (pioneered by Schema.org), RDFa (standardized by the W3C), and JSON-LD, which we already saw in Section 3.8. ([Location 1831](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09CLX2Z45&location=1831))_

----
When the portal is backed by RDF, there is no difference between building a distributed web portal and one in which all the information is local. Using RDF, federated web portals are as easy as siloed portals. ([Location 1973](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09CLX2Z45&location=1973))_

----
URIs also have a deferencing mechanism, that is, a method that uses the URI to find a location on the Web from which further information can be loaded. Applications use this universal identification mechanism to ensure they are processing the right data in the right way and they use the dereferencing mechanism to obtain more data on demand. ([Location 2085](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09CLX2Z45&location=2085))_

----
Information about the publication is available both in human-readable HTML form, as shown in Figure 5.4, which is available at the URL https://dblp.org/rec/html/books/daglib/0028543, and in machine-readable form in RDF, which is available from the URL https://dblp.org/rec/rdf/books/daglib/0028543. The triples for this part of the data sets are given in Turtle format in Figure 5.5. ([Location 2425](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09CLX2Z45&location=2425))_

## New highlights added January 19, 2023 at 3:33 PM
Representational State Transfer (REST), a set of recommendations for how to organize and publicize a service on the Web. REST could be a topic of a book in its own right, but the basic structure of REST is that it ensures service interoperability over the Web, based on accessing and manipulating representations of resources through a small, uniform, and predefined set of operations (in particular, the standard HTTP methods GET, PUT, PATCH, POST, and DELETE). A service that complies with the REST principles is said to be RESTful. ([Location 2596](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09CLX2Z45&location=2596))_

Linked Data Platform (LDP) [Speicher et al. 2015], which specifies how Web applications can publish, edit, and delete data resources using the HTTP protocol. LDP is a standardized specification of how to use REST access to linked data, ([Location 2601](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09CLX2Z45&location=2601))_
