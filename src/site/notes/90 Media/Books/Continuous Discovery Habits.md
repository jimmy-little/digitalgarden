## Highlights
I’ll refer to the work that you do to decide what to build as discovery and the work that you do to build and ship a product as delivery.1 This distinction matters. As you’ll see, many companies put a heavy emphasis on delivery—they focus on whether you shipped what you said you would on time and on budget—while under-investing in discovery, forgetting to assess if you built the right stuff.

And finally, teams continued to be measured by what they delivered, not whether anyone used it or if it created any value for the customer or the business. ([Location 167](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B094PVB97X&location=167))_
