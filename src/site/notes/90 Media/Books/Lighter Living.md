“ma” is a Japanese word which can be roughly translated as “gap,” “space,” “pause” or “the space between two structural parts.” Ma has also been described as “an emptiness full of possibilities, like a promise yet to be fulfilled” and as “the silence between the notes that make the music.” ([Location 98](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07YBV835S&location=98))_
