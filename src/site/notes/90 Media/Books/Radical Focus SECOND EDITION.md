## Highlights
General George Patton quote: “Don’t tell people how to do things, tell them what you need done and let them surprise you with their results.” ([Location 148](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B091ZL2SRL&location=148))_

----
you can release all the features you want, but if it doesn’t solve the underlying business problem, you haven’t really solved anything. ([Location 150](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B091ZL2SRL&location=150))_

----
It’s not important to protect an idea. It’s important to protect the time it takes to make it real. ([Location 183](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B091ZL2SRL&location=183))_

The system I use is made up of three simple parts. One: Set inspiring and measurable goals. Two: Make sure you and your team are always making progress toward that desired end state. No matter how many other things are on your plate. And three: Set a cadence that makes sure the group both remembers what they are trying to accomplish and holds each other accountable.

Key Results are how you know if you’ve achieved them (downloads of 25K/day, revenue $50K/day). ([Location 191](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B091ZL2SRL&location=191))_

----
The Objective is inspiring and motivates those people who don’t dig numbers. For those who do love numbers, the Key Results keep the Objective real. I know I’ve got a good Objective when I leap out of bed in the morning eager to make it happen. I know I’ve got the right Key Results when I am also a little scared you can’t make them.

----
A start-up’s enemy is time, and the enemy of timely execution is distraction. ([Location 222](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B091ZL2SRL&location=222))_

----
a pivot is a change in tactics without making a change in strategy. ([Location 341](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B091ZL2SRL&location=341))_
