An OBJECTIVE, I explained, is simply WHAT is to be achieved, no more and no less. By definition, objectives are significant, concrete, action oriented, and (ideally) inspirational. When properly designed and deployed, they’re a vaccine against fuzzy thinking—and fuzzy execution. ([Location 172](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078FZ9SYB&location=172))

KEY RESULTS benchmark and monitor HOW we get to the objective. Effective KRs are specific and time-bound, aggressive yet realistic. Most of all, they are measurable and verifiable. (As prize pupil Marissa Mayer would say, “It’s not a key result unless it has a number.”) ([Location 175](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078FZ9SYB&location=175))

----
Where an objective can be long-lived, rolled over for a year or longer, key results evolve as the work progresses. Once they are all completed, the objective is necessarily achieved. (And if it isn’t, the OKR was poorly designed in the first place.) ([Location 178](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078FZ9SYB&location=178))

OKRs surface your primary goals. They channel efforts and coordination. They link diverse operations, lending purpose and unity to the entire organization. ([Location 188](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078FZ9SYB&location=188))

“hard goals” drive performance more effectively than easy goals. Second, specific hard goals “produce a higher level of output” than vaguely worded ones. ([Location 205](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078FZ9SYB&location=205))_

----
Among experiments in the field, 90 percent confirm that productivity is enhanced by well-defined, challenging goals. ([Location 208](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078FZ9SYB&location=208))_

----
In larger enterprises, OKRs are neon-lit road signs. They demolish silos and cultivate connections among far-flung contributors. ([Location 247](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078FZ9SYB&location=247))_

----
Many companies have a “rule of seven,” limiting managers to a maximum of seven direct reports. In some cases, Google has flipped the rule to a minimum of seven. (When Jonathan Rosenberg headed Google’s product team, he had as many as twenty.) The higher the ratio of reports, the flatter the org chart—which means less top-down ([Location 266](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078FZ9SYB&location=266))_

----
down oversight, greater frontline autonomy, and more fertile soil for the next breakthrough. OKRs help make all of these good things possible. ([Location 269](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078FZ9SYB&location=269))_

the four OKR “superpowers”: focus, align, track, and stretch. ([Location 298](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078FZ9SYB&location=298))_

It’s a milestone. The two are not the same. . . . The key result has to be measurable. But at the end you can look, and without any arguments: Did I do that or did I not do it? Yes? No? Simple. No judgments in it. ([Location 375](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078FZ9SYB&location=375))_

When people help choose a course of action, they are more likely to see it through. ([Location 396](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078FZ9SYB&location=396))_

----
Less is more. “A few extremely well-chosen objectives,” Grove wrote, “impart a clear message about what we say ‘yes’ to and what we say ‘no’ to.” A limit of three to five OKRs per cycle leads companies, teams, and individuals to choose what matters most. In general, each objective should be tied to five or fewer key results. ([Location 513](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078FZ9SYB&location=513))_

----
Set goals from the bottom up. To promote engagement, teams and individuals should be encouraged to create roughly half of their own OKRs, in consultation with managers. ([Location 516](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078FZ9SYB&location=516))_

----
No dictating. OKRs are a cooperative social contract to establish priorities and define how progress will be measured. ([Location 519](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078FZ9SYB&location=519))_

----
Stay flexible. If the climate has changed and an objective no longer seems practical or relevant as written, key results can be modified or even discarded mid-cycle. ([Location 521](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078FZ9SYB&location=521))_

----
Dare to fail. “Output will tend to be greater,” Grove wrote, “when everybody strives for a level of achievement beyond [their] immediate grasp. ([Location 523](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078FZ9SYB&location=523))_

----
A tool, not a weapon. The OKR system, Grove wrote, “is meant to pace a person—to put a stopwatch in his own hand so he can gauge his own performance. It is not a legal document upon which to base a performance review.” ([Location 528](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078FZ9SYB&location=528))_

----
Be patient; be resolute. Every process requires trial and error. As Grove told his iOPEC students, Intel “stumbled a lot of times” after adopting OKRs: “We didn’t fully understand the principal purpose of it. ([Location 531](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078FZ9SYB&location=531))_

----
If you tell everybody to go to the center of Europe, and some start marching off to France, and some to Germany, and some to Italy, that’s no good—not if you want them all going to Switzerland. If the vectors point in different directions, they add up to zero. But if you get everybody pointing in the same direction, you maximize the results. ([Location 569](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078FZ9SYB&location=569))_

I doubt I ever had a key result that said, “Walk around to stay on top of employees’ morale.” We wrote down the things that needed special emphasis. ([Location 587](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078FZ9SYB&location=587))_

----
Microprocessors were Intel’s best hope for the future, and we had to get back on top. I can still remember the first slide of one early presentation: Crush, the purpose: To establish a sense of urgency and set in motion critical, corporate-wide decisions and action plans to address a life-threatening competitive challenge.

Leaders must get across the why as well as the what. Their people need more than milestones ([Location 714](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078FZ9SYB&location=714))_

for motivation. They are thirsting for meaning, to understand how their goals relate to the mission. And the process can’t stop with unveiling top-line OKRs at a quarterly all-hands meeting. As LinkedIn CEO Jeff Weiner likes to say, “When you are tired of saying it, people are starting to hear it.” ([Location 714](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078FZ9SYB&location=714))_

Objectives and key results are the yin and yang of goal setting—principle and practice, vision and execution. ([Location 717](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078FZ9SYB&location=717))_

We don’t hire smart people to tell them what to do. We hire smart people so they can tell us what to do. —Steve Jobs ([Location 1058](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078FZ9SYB&location=1058))_

As I see it, co-ownership weakens accountability. ([Location 1270](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078FZ9SYB&location=1270))_

----
Even when two or more teams have parallel objectives, their key results should be distinct. ([Location 1271](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078FZ9SYB&location=1271))_

----
First, we had to define our capacity constraints for developing new software. Then we had to clarify our core priorities. ([Location 1298](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078FZ9SYB&location=1298))_

One underrated virtue of OKRs is that they can be tracked—and then revised or adapted as circumstances dictate. ([Location 1482](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078FZ9SYB&location=1482))_

OBJECTIVE Establish the 8086 as the highest-performance 16-bit microprocessor family, as measured by: KEY RESULTS (Q2 1980) Develop and publish five benchmarks showing superior 8086 family performance [0.6]. Repackage the entire 8086 family of products [1.0]. Get the 8MHz part into production [0]. Sample the arithmetic coprocessor no later than June 15 [0.9]. And here is how these scores were determined: We completed three of five benchmarks for an 0.6, a borderline green. We did indeed repackage the 8086 family, under a new product line called iAPX. So that’s a perfect 1.0. Production of the 8MHz part, set for early May, was a fiasco.* Because of problems with the polysilicon, the target had to be pushed to October. That’s a zero. As for the arithmetic coprocessor, the goal was to ship 500 parts by June 15. We wound up shipping 470—which computes to 0.9, another green.
